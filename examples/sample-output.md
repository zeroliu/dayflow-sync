Productive day overall. Completed the authentication refactor ahead of schedule, which feels great. The documentation took longer than expected but it's comprehensive now. Need to remember to take breaks more regularly - got too absorbed in coding after lunch. Happy with the exercise commitment.

Balanced work with personal time and exercise. Strong code review participation and team collaboration during standup.
